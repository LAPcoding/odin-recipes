<h2>How to Make Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>

<p>Making buttermilk pancakes for your Saturday mornings? Our reliable fluffy buttermilk pancake recipe features classic pancake ingredients, real buttermilk, and a hint of vanilla. Don’t forget the maple syrup!</p>

<p>We make pancakes weekly in our house. Most of the time, I substitute half the all-purpose flour with spelt or whole wheat pastry flour and top our pancakes with fruit,. But sometimes, it’s nice to go with classic buttermilk pancakes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure there are no clumps.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk the egg until the yolk and the white are combined. Add the buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined.</li>
    <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. If adding berries or chocolate, add them when the batter is not quite fully mixed. Continue mixing just until combined. Don’t over mix, or your pancakes will be rubbery not light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Set a large, flat-bottomed non-stick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Once the butter has melted and sizzles on the pan, scoop a rounded 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan. Add additional scoops to cook more pancakes, spaced a few inches apart.

        Cook until you see bubbles forming in the center of the pancakes, and the edges look slightly drier than the middle, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for about 2 minutes on the other side. The cakes should be lightly golden on both sides with crispy edges.</li>
    <li>Serve with maple syrup or powdered sugar and fruit. If feeding a crowd, keep warm on a plate in a low oven until ready to serve.</li>
