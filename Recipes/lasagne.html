<h2>The Secret Behind This Classic Lasagna Recipe</h2>

<p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more 
    cheese than most other recipes.</p>

<p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to 
    the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 tsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>1/2 bell pepper, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 (28 oz) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>3 oz tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp fresh oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp red or white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 lbs mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 lb freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Put a large pot of seasoned water on the 
        stovetop on high heat.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet heat 2 tbsp olive oil 
        on medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook
        until it is lightly brown on all sides. Remove
        the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain
        off all but a tbsp of fat.</li>
    <li>Add the bell pepper and onions to the skillet
        Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until onions are 
        translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 
        30 seconds. Return the ground beef to the pan. 
        Stir to combine, reduce heat to low and Cook
        for another 5 mins.</li>
    <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized pot
        Add the chrushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and
        tomato paste to the pot. Add parsley, oregano
        Italian seasoning, garlic powder and red or white 
        wine vinegar. Stir in sugar a tbsp at a time,
        tasting after each addition. Add salt to taste
        Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the
        heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 
        45 mins, stirring often. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>By now the water should be boiling. Add the 
        noodles and cook them to al dente. Stir often
        to prevent from sticking. Drain and rinse with 
        cold water gently separating any noodles that 
        may be sticking together. Spread a little olive
        oil on a cooking sheet and coat the noodles with 
        the oil.</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 375 F</li>
    <li>In a 9x13-inch casserole dish ladle a cup of
        sauce over the bottom of the dish. Arrange 
        one layer of noodles lengthwise over the sauce.
        Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the
        noodles. Sprinkle a third to the mozzarella 
        on top of the sauce. Add half the ricotta 
        cheese and then half of the parmesan. Repeat 
        another layer. Finish with another layer of
        noodles. Spread the reamining sauce over the 
        noodles and sprinkle with the remaining 
        mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan with foil, tented slightly so 
        it doesn't touch the lasagne. Bake at 375F for
        45 mins. Uncover for the last 10 mins to get a 
        crusty top.</li>
    <li>Allow lasagne to cool at least 15 mins before
        serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days.
