<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 lb large raw shrimp, shelled and de-veined</li>
    <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2-3 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, slivered</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
    <li>2 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat a sauté pan on high heat then reduce to medium high heat. Swirl the butter and olive oil into the pan. After the butter melts it will foam up a bit then subside. If using unsalted butter, sprinkle a little salt in the pan. Stir in the slivered garlic and red pepper flakes.</li>
    <li>Sauté the garlic for just a minute, until it begins to brown lightly on the edges, then add the shrimp.

        Add the wine and stir to coat the shrimp.
        
        Move the shrimp, so they are in an even layer in the pan. Increase the heat to high and boil the wine for about two minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir the shrimp and arrange them so you turn them over to cook on the other side. Continue to cook on high heat for another minute.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle the shrimp with parsley, lemon juice, and black pepper, and toss to combine.</li> 
    <li>Serve as is, or with crusty bread, over pasta, or over rice (for a gluten-free version).</li>
